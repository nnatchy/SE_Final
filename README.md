I just want to try to implement CRUD application with golang using firebase as the database.
It might have some of errors but it's my first time doing project with golang and I have to do my embedded-project during this period. So sorry if this doesn't work 100% correct ;w;

P.S. tbh, I just do the whole project in 1 day so I'm surely there is something wrong after I implement mongoDB in it. ;-; 

### tools that I use in the project:
1. gorilla/mux
2. swagger
3. mongoDB (database)
